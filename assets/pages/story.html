      <h1>Annie's Story</h1>
      <p>
        Marcin was a quiet and unnoticed bartender in a tavern filled with
        trouble. One day, a little girl with red hair and a tattered bear
        entered the tavern and asked for a glass of milk. A bounty hunter at the
        bar engaged in a conversation with the girl, who revealed that her
        parents were dead. The girl accidentally dropped a large purse filled
        with Noxian coins, drawing attention. The bounty hunter tried to take
        advantage of the situation, but the girl claimed that her bear, Tibbers,
        had devoured the man who had given her the purse. Chaos ensued as the
        girl unleashed a burst of fire, causing Marcin to take cover. When he
        looked again, a monstrous burning bear stood in the flames, holding the
        lifeless body of the bounty hunter. The girl spoke to the bear,
        confirming that it didn't like being pulled either. The tavern was
        engulfed in flames, and the girl and the bear left, leaving behind
        destruction and thanking Marcin for the milk as they disappeared into
        the snowy night.
